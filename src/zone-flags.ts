/**
 * This file can be used to configure global behavior of Marble.js before the
 * application starts.
 *
 * Just import this file in your `main.ts` file.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```typescript
 * import './zone-flags';
 * ```
 *
 * You can add the following flags to your zone-flags.ts file:
 *
 * (window as any).__Zone_disable_requestAnimationFrame = true; // disable patch requestAnimationFrame
 * (window as any).__Zone_disable_on_property = true; // disable patch onProperty such as onclick
 * (window as any).__zone_symbol__UNPATCHED_EVENTS = ['scroll', 'mousemove']; // disable patch specified eventNames
 *
 *  in IE/Edge developer tools, the addEventListener will also be wrapped by zone.js
 *  with the following flag, it will bypass `zone.js` patch for IE/Edge
 *
 *  (window as any).__Zone_enable_cross_context_check = true;
